# Exception_Handler

This challenge project was part of the C# fundamentals cerification. The purpose of this challenge was to review a given code, correct any logic errors, and then impliment exception handling code in order for the program to recover from furhter errors due to unexpected or uncontrolled inputs.

This code demonstrates the use of creating custom excpetion messages and utilizing tools such as the "try-catch" exception handling method and the "throw" method. The initial tasks of reviewing the code and correcting any logic errors reinforced the some of the basics of the C# utilities. Such as: math operations, void type vs. return type methods, "while" loops, "for" loops, calling methods and passing arguments, initializing variables and arrays, determining variable scope, and basic tools of the console clear and write methods.
